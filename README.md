# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
Meghan Bourassa

I have decided to take this class because in all honesty, I do need the upper division credits. At least, that was the original reason. I know a couple of people who have taken this class and they're the ones who brought this up to me. I thought I'd take a shot at it because I know nothing of coding or websites really. I figured, hey, you use a website everyday, learn how to create it. So, here I am! 

- I'm amazed at how much is put into just one website
- There's so much information tracked from your computer to a website destination, but it's effortless and quick
- There's a lot of numbers in servers.
