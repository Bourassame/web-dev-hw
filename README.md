# My First README.md

Well, after going through this again and actually finishing it. I can say my problems were that I got myself confused and it took me three weeks to understand our website and Atom. But here I am! Finally finishing it! I'm also glad that Justine is meeting with me on Thursday to go over the second assignment and get me all on track so I can finally stop having problems.

Thank you Justine!
