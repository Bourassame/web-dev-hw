# My First README.md

Well, after going through this again and actually finishing it. I can say my problems were that I got myself confused and it took me three weeks to understand our website and Atom. But here I am! Finally finishing it! I'm also glad that Justine is meeting with me on Thursday to go over the second assignment and get me all on track so I can finally stop having problems.

I, now, somewhat understand the connection between Atom and the desktop version of GitHub. This way I'm able to have everything updated online! Progress! 

Thank you Justine!
