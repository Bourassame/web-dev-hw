#Assignment 4
Alt text (alternative text) is a word or phrase that can be inserted as an attribute in an HTML document to tell Web site viewers the nature or contents of an image. So, it gives viewers a little more information. We use it for more info.

While browsing the web in the past, I've used a lot of forms for filling out information about myself. Like credit card information and when I applied for different jobs and such.

My work cycle for this assignment, of course, I had issues. There's something about adding an image that I mess up a billion times trying to get the right route to find the image later on.
