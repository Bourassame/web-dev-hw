  <h3>Lyrics</h3>
  Yeah-eh-heah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way</br>
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way</br>
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way</br>
Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way</br>
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way</br>
Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be Yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me</br>
You are my fire
The one desire
You are (you are you are you are)
Don't want to hear you say</br>
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
(Don't want to hear you say)
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way</br>
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way</br>
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
(Never want to hear you say it)
I want it that way</br>
'Cause I want it that way
